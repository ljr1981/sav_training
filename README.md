Setup
=====
On a Windows box, there are several environment variables you will want to set up:

1. GITHUB -> Points at the directory where you keep your GitHub projects. This is so you can use other GitHub libraries that you create.

2. ISE_LIBRARY -> Points to the default location of the program files for your Eiffel Studio installation. On Windows, this is the C:\Projgram Files (x86) directory for Eiffel Studio.

3. ISE_EIFFEL -> Points to the same location as ISE_LIBRARY.

NOTE: #2/3 above ought to be set up automatically for you by Eiffel Studio when it loads (at least in Windows--Mac, I don't know). Otherwise, only GITHUB is something to ensure is set up properly.
